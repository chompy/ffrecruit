Role
1 Healer (pure healer highly preferred, but will switch for the right shield healer)
   -Non :gnb: tanks may apply; we can flex for the right person.

Schedule
Prog: 4 hours a day, 4 days a week
Regular Schedule: 1-2 nights a week for weekly clears
We typically raid in the late evenings (10:00 PM - 2:00 AM).

About Us
We're a long-time static who has cleared all 5 Ultimates together on-patch. Our main goal is to progress Ultimates as quickly as possible. We complete the Savage tiers blind for the challenge and fun of it. Other content that we have enjoyed doing together include Bozja/Eureka, MINE Blue Mage, Criterion Savage, and Dungeon speedruns. Our group has strong camaraderie and we wish to build upon it with the inclusion of our newest member. For more information on our group's achievements, you can check out our tomestone page.

Requirements

    Have a working mic to communicate with. Raid communication is essential.
    Have a desire or interest in blind savage prog. If you want to spoil strats/clear week 1, we are not the group for you.
    Be responsible and easy going. We take our raid time seriously, but the challenge and fun together is our ethos.
    A prog-oriented mindset. Be able to adapt quickly and focus on mechanics. Know how to push the boundaries of your job.
    Ability to progress in difficult content without using tools such as Auto-Markers or raid/mechanic simulators.
    Clears in Ultimates on-patch are preferred (the more the better); however, if you haven't at least cleared one ultimate we will only consider a trial if you:
        Resonate strongly with our ideals
        Are confident you will be a good fit
        Meet all other requirements


If you're interested, please include in your DM why you're interested in joining our group.

7/8 looking for a regen :heal: for the upcoming savage tier in Dawntrail as well as some fun runs of MINE content for the remainder of the expansion. For the savage tier the goal is to clear the tier within 3-4 weeks, however, as I will be doing two groups and doing HC week 1 prog, we will not begin prog until week 2 of the tier being released. During that first week everyone is encouraged to go into PF to get experience with the fights if they so desire, however this is not mandatory.

Experience wise, 5/7 of the group are now penta legends, as we recently finished doing a shotgun trip of going through all of the ultimates in order to get people their missing clears, with the remaining two being quad legends (one joined us after we'd already finished DSR, the other left temporarily before TOP). The RPR who is a quad legend will also have this be their very first savage tier since they were a new player upon joining us for ultimates, but the rest of the group has between moderate and extensive savage experience.

Schedule: Fri/Sat/Sun 9:00 PM - 1:15 AM (time is converted to your local timezone). Please note that this is potentially subject to be changed around for Dawntrail if the group wishes.

One thing of import to note is that the group consists of a majority of trans women or other LGBT individuals. So it goes without saying that intolerance towards that sort of thing isn't going to be, well, tolerated.

What is the goal of this static?
As a newly forming static going into DT, our goal is to be able to clear new Savage tier within 2 weeks of release, with being able to clear the first 3 bosses of a tier by Thursday. In regards to Ultimates, out goal is to clear before the release of the next patch.

What are we looking for in a player?
We are looking for players that are both strong and consistant in their jobs and role they are playing at. We are looking for players who are able to at leasty try and study up ahead of time, with the mindset of studying at least one mechanic ahead of whateve progression point we are on, preferably the entire fight for the first 3 fights. We are also looking for players that constantly looking to optimize especially during the last boss of the tier when checks are at their tightest. Don't be afraid to ask questions or advice if your struggling with understanding or executing a mechanic, but we do expect you undertand your job. Otherwise we are looking to build a chill group that can otherwise have fun with each other (it is a game after all). 

DM if interested or if you have any questions.

About Us
We're a group of semi-hardcore raiders who have been playing together throughout Shadowbringers and Endwalker, now looking to fill our ranks. The group has week one experience and a few penta legends in it. Ultimate clears are not required to reach out, we give everyone a fair shot.
Roles

    1 Pure Healer :whm: | :ast:
    1 Shield Healer :sch: | :sge:


We're currently in need of two healers, experienced Duos are encouraged to apply. No red flags please...
Tentative Schedule(EST)

    Tues/Wed/Thurs - 11:30 PM to 3:30 AM
    Week 1 - Most/All Members will be opening their work/life schedules so we will do our best to put in as many 'productive' hours as we can.

Expectations

    This is not an alarm clock team. - However we do expect to finish the tier by the weekend at most but shooting for sooner.
    Experience clearing other tiers.
    Have a good mental. - Week one will have its ups and downs, be prepared for the challenge.
    Don't be a bigot. - Lots of people from different backgrounds just trying to have fun, if that doesn't mesh well with you move along.
    Be open to criticism and bring a good attitude everyday.
    Know your class. - Utilize the resources available to become well-versed in your job. New expansions generally change how a job is played.
    Be open to flexibility in strat adjustments.
    Non toxic. - Mistakes happen. Owning up to them saves time and helps the group move on to the next pull. We take the time to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it. No hurling blame unnecessarily.
    Be willing to put in time to study and research outside of raid.
    Be punctual, be consistent. - The time for trying out crazy strats and risky optimization will come post week one.
    Know when it's time to put on your game face and focus on the clear.
    Lastly, have fun. - The people around you are gonna be silly and stupid it's ok to be the same.

Current Comp:

    Tank 1 :war~1: | :drk:
    Tank 2 :gnb: | :pld:
    Melee 1 Viper | :sam:

[LFM][NA DC][7.0+][2/8][HC/sHC][W2-W4]

I am looking to recruit players to clear the savage tier within a month. Throughout Endwalker I led groups for all three savage turns and learned more and more about raiding in this game and what I'm looking to get out of all of it; I am working towards becoming a world racer and believe that clearing a raid tier within a month is the next big step towards that.

Expectations are mostly standard; own up to mistakes, take criticism, be on time, have a good attitude, communicate effectively, and play consistently.

Raid times are TBD, but we are looking to run for at least 30-40 hours week 1 with intent to do more if schedules permit. Alarm clocking day 1 is on the table, but not certain. Weeks 2 onward, unless we can confidently push a full clear, we will discuss reducing hours and by how much.

Currently we have a Melee (leaning Samurai, but uncertain atm) and a Caster (Primarily Pictomancer with intent of SMN/RDM for prog). We are looking to recruit people for all other roles but melee as we have gotten a large quantity of tryouts for the role and are not looking for more at the moment. We are still accepting trials for tanks, healers, and phys range.

We will begin tryouts as people show interest. Please DM me for more information.

In need of: :brd: / :dnc:  / :mch: 

Schedule: 
10:00 PM - 1:00 AM 
Tuesday / Wednesday / Friday

Hi folks, 
Our static is looking for a Phys Ranged player to join us for Blind Savage Prog! This group is NOT a week 1 group, we are a static that is going to be operating on midcore hours and getting the blind experience. This means that we will be avoiding watching the world race, avoiding PF, and avoiding any sort of information regarding the raids. 

This group is also interested in doing FRU (Eden Ulti) but we are NOT going to be doing that blind.

Here is what we are looking for in our candidates:

1: Driven to clear. 
Everyone in this group is going to be preparing themselves for raid before each day. This means reviewing our raid plans, resting properly, and being mentally prepared each day.

2: Experienced.
As this is going to be a group compromised of players with quite a bit of experience, we are going to be looking for players on a similar level. Minimum requirements would be a savage tier clear on content, and some form of ultimate clears. Everyone in this group has cleared DSR, and we have multiple penta legends. 

3: Communicative.
Don't shake the bottle and close the cap! If you have any issues or concerns regarding play, strategies, mit planning, or anything else express your concerns. Blind is an experience all about teamwork, problem solving, and cooperation. Communication is a massive part of that. 

4: Punctual.
Nothing is more frustrating then having 7 folks who are exciting to raid who are ready on time, while one trails behind. Punctuality is something this group finds incredibly important!!! If you are unable to make it to raid for some reason you are going to be expected to communicate that ahead of time.

If this interests you please send me your logs and we can chat! I am excited to speak with you all.

The primary intention is induviduals who are looking to join are non-toxic induviduals. There will be trials and although game mechanics are important/skill with a job the most important aspect is mentality. Individuals who yell/get angry/ do not like modifying strats on demand as required will not be accepted. 

This group will also be doing content up to the release of dawntrail on a modified schedule to be discussed once we get the group together.

Schedule is not set in stone however we are aiming for 3/4 days a week + Weekends:

M: Empty
T: 0700-2000 CST
W: 1800-Midnight CST

About the static:
-We are a mix of Ultimate veterans and newbies. Some of us have been playing together for 3-8years, and some joined during the last tier. 
-This recruitment is for clearing DSR and possibly for the next tier if the recruit is a good fit.
-We do take the raid and people's time very seriously, but not at the expense of our health and family. Don't join if you're Super-HC or Casual.

Rules and Philosophy:
-Mechanics > Uptime, Consistency > Heroism, iRL > Game.
-Respect people's time, and do not argue or discuss/ask irrelevant things during raids.
-Strats will be discussed, and provided OUTSIDE of raid time. It's your responsibility to know the Strats this static is doing. 
-Be willing to listen to constructive criticism and follow instructions. Have a thick enough skin for harmless jokes.
-We currently use Mumble for Voice Chat due to a few members having issue with discord.

Looking to start a w1 long term static for savage and ultimates for the near future.
Currently 4/8 recruiting for Any Phys :ranged:  and Non-VPR :melee: , We are in the process of trialing healers and tanks atm

Schedule

    Potential alarm clocking day one on server going live, otherwise 14-16 hour days all of w1 starting at 8am CST and ending around 12am Midnight CST with a couple of long 30-60 min or so breaks for food and rest during the day.


About us

    We are a group of friends that raided together back in Abyssos and decided to get together again to form a strong raiding group moving forward. All of us are Penta Legends except our tank but he will be by dawntrail drop, have many tiers w1/w2 in the past and want to push harder for the future.


Goals

    We plan on clearing w1 or sooner, reclearing on following weeks with splits, and eventually doing opti/speeds and or progging ultis for fun.


Expectations

    Must be very proficient with your role, being a otp is unacceptable in a HC prog scenario
    Must have voice communication with the group at all times
    Must have a prog focused mindset, not a dummy parse brain.
    Just be a chill person, this is a group of good friends and exceptional players, shitty people will not be tolerated.
    Able to take the full first week off except for monday for the full 14-16 hour days.
    Must be able to raid consistantly for long hours. Obviously lmao
    Have a raid ready alt for split clears starting w2

Currently looking for a non-war :tank: . We are looking for people who have cleared TOP (will take meteors+ if consistent and experienced) to do reclears with us. We will then be speed-progging through TEA and UWU before dawntrail.

About us
Group is looking for a long-term member focused on completing content while it is fresh. We intend to do splits for the next savage tier, and jump straight into FRU the moment it is released. As such, we are looking for an experienced player who can hold their own. We are a hodgepodge of alpha through penta legends who enjoy doing both raid and non-raid content together!  We have (as a group) cleared DSR/UCOB/TOP thus far, are currently reclearing TOP and then moving onto TEA/UWU.

Current Roster:

:machinist: https://www.fflogs.com/character/na/cactuar/quality%20player
:BLM: https://www.fflogs.com/character/na/adamantoise/v'phrena%20yarhu

We are looking for people who are:

• Punctual.
• Pleasant.
• Can Communicate.
• Consistent

Make sure we keep a prog > parse mentality going. Expectations will be set on what to study before raid, and will be multiple mechanics ahead of where the group is in case of miracle prog.

We ask that everyone be adults about communicating problems with raid members. Be able to take constructive criticism, everyone is responsible for optimizing themselves and improving. We have a lighthearted, but serious when necessary environment. Be prepared to shoot the shit, laugh when someone gets dunked on and have a good time.

    Be respectful and have patience
    Look at guides and sometimes maybe even clear vods for your role ahead of raid as this isn’t a blind static
    Have fun this isn’t a 9-5


Times for raid is Thurs/Fri/Sat from 10:00 PM-1:00 AM (2 lockouts). 

Looking for:
:Tank: Tank | GNB, PAL, or DRK
:heal: Pure Healer | AST or WHM

About Us
Established group of 4 FFXIV raider friends forming a group for DT.  Looking for a consistent and fast-learning player to fill out the last spot. Our p9-12 clear was week 2, we’re looking to very seriously push for week 1 on all 3 tiers for DT. It’s gonna be week 1 or bust, as some members don’t want to prog into week 2-so the tone for week 1 needs to be very focused and serious. 
In general, I’m trying to avoid the “co-worker” vibe that happens in a lot of statics. We can have fun after week 1, but week 1 it’s game time baby. 
Our TOP clear was week 6. We are trying to clear the DT Ultimate(s) in 4-5 weeks.

If you’re interested, and meet the ^mandatory stuff, hit me up with your logs and some info about you.

The group has been focusing on blind prog for the entirety of endwalker and got an early week 2 clear on Asphodelos, Abyssos and Anabaseios and we're aiming for the week 1 on the 7.0 tiers.

Our expectations with the new members are:
Previous week 1 or 2 prog experience
Being used to raiding for long periods of time
The ability to study and come up with our strategies (previous blind prog experience is a plus)
Be able to study outside of our raid time so no prog time is wasted

Join discord call for prog
Have an alt caught up for week 2, for split clears

Schedule:
Week 1: 10h or more everyday since patch day, starting around 2/3pm EST
Week 2 and beyond: Split clears everyday until reclears are done for the week starting around 9pm EST (schedule is flexible for week 2)

7/8 group looking for a skilled healer for 7.0 savage and eden ultimate!

Goal: 

Top 20 or higher, day 2 clear of the tier at the latest. Optimization/ultimate practice to improve for world racing in future content.

Group overview:

Hello! Unwind is a HC static that formed right before TOP and achieved a week 3 clear. In our first savage(6.4 Anabaseios) we ranked 17. We are currently looking to round out our roster in hopes of tackling the upcoming expansion with hardcore hours. We are looking for other gamers that love to challenge new raiding content and still wish to push for a clear as fast as possible!

Requirements for upcoming savage tier:

Able to take days off work for hardcore prog
Have the endurance and commitment to raid multiple long hour days (16 hours per day at least)
Previous week 1 savage clears
Previous HC prog
Clears of previous ultimates
Confidence and flexibility within your role
Ability to learn mechanics quickly and perform consistently
Good and punctual attendance
Able to communicate effectively over voice chat
Able to give and take criticism well
Alt available for split clears for loot
And most importantly - have a good attitude, be genuinely friendly, and get along well with others

Static's page: https://www.fflogs.com/guild/id/111876/ 

Ideal healer candidates should be looking for a long term group and have the drive and mentality to achieve our goals. We will be practicing 3-4 days per week leading up to savage with general raid times being evening EST hours (somewhere between 6 PM EST - 1 AM EST roughly).

Msg me at Scarlet#8880 for more info if you think you fit these criteria and have a general love for raiding!

4/8 Static Looking for Members for Dawntrail/Upcoming Ultimate

I am Alex and I am a :ranged: and Fox is a :caster: and we're a pair of friends that have cleared TOP on patch as well as several ultimates together looking to meet new friends to raid with in the future. We plan to raid every night of Week 1 from 6-12 EST to frontload our schedule, reducing hours for subsequent weeks. 

Overall we would like to clear ASAP, but we work, so after week 1 we would like to reduce our times down to 4 days for 4 hours for prog, less for reclears. The days will based on availability. We will not raid Tuesdays after week 1/2, so this is your opportunity to cap or do other things you would like to do. The plan is to clear hopefully by Week 2 or 3, but we are generally more interested in building a friendly like-minded team. 

Currently we are looking for:
2 :heal:  2 :melee:

As a requirement, we ask that you have cleared TOP since we may wish to revisit that fight at some point. Otherwise, please feel free to DM me with any questions as well as your role, logs and availability. For your consideration our logs are included. The last raid tier our group retired early and many of our clears are in PF, but looking further back you may see how the two of us perform historically.

[LFM] [SAVAGE] [SEMI-CASUAL] [7/8] [NA]

We are a queer-friendly semi casual to midcore static, with a slightly more casual approach, looking to recruit for progging and clearing the current raid tier. We would like to eventually tackle Ultimate fights as well. We are looking for a player who has some experience tackling high-end content, is comfortable with their rotation and that cleared P19-12 since we're currently progging Para3 on P12S. However, no prior static experience is necessary!

So far, the team composition is:

Tanks: All
Healers: All
DPS: Reaper, Summoner, Machinist

Raid times are: 
Tuesday 9:00 - 11:00 PM EST
Sunday  9:00 - 11:00 PM EST
(Although, we can go for longer depending on how the group is feeling).

Expectations 
Please be patient while progging and try to have a positive demeanor.
Transparency about your schedule is appreciated. Please keep us updated if there’s a shift in your schedule that might affect the rest of the static.
Be open to constructive criticism! Feedback is necessary for growth, and we are a static committed to becoming better players.
We are a mixed group of raiders so bigotry, racism, sexism, etc. will not be tolerated. Off-color humor and banter is okay (and expected) between friends but we’d like to foster a group where everyone feels comfortable.
Join Discord voice call during raids.

Roles needed:
Melee DPS

If interested, message @Shinso Rhalgr or @Mimi Abeille [𝕮𝔯𝔶𝔰𝔱𝔞𝔩] on discord!

[NA] [Aether] [Savage] [7.0] [Static] [LFM] [7/8] [Casual/sMC]

Hello! Looking to finish putting together a group for 7.0 Savage with a non-PLD :Tank: .
 
At this moment, our group is missing just one member to complete us. I have cleared the last two tiers of content with a previous static, which then disbanded. I'm trying my hand at leading a static and getting together a group to get through this content with. Our general vibe is a group that enjoys tackling this harder content, while staying relatively laid back yet focused. We have casual times, but these times should be more than enough to make meaningful progress every week.

Raid Time:
Wed 6-8PM PST
Thu 6-8PM PST

We are planning on starting with some EX progging/farming next week to build some synergy as a team.

Members:
:pld: 
:whm: 
:heal: 
:melee: x 2
:smn: 
:dnc: 

We are looking for players that are:

1) Are punctual and committed to raid time, please be on time and have looked at future mechanics to be prepared for when we see them.
2) Can communicate when they won't be available for a raid day to give me plenty of time to fill the spot
3) Staying positive and focusing on progress. I've had some times where our group got dragged down from some negativity and want to avoid that.
4) Communicative and willing to take constructive criticism. We all make mistakes, and it's important to be able to understand what happened in a wipe to be able to learn and move forward.
5) Being in VC during raid times is a must. You do not have to talk, but we want you to at least be there for listening to call outs and explanations.
6) Wanting to generally have fun and have a good time during raid!

Contact me in a DM if interested!

LFM HC/WP [7.0] [Savage] [Aether] [NA]

1x :heal: healer
1x   :Tank:  tank

Hello,
We are a HC static looking for the above mentioned roles. We are a hardcore static that will be doing long hours (pretty much World Prog hours - 16h~) w1 for the upcoming savage. 

The core of this group has multiple w1s and early Ulti clears together and are seeking like-minded individuals that want to push themselves even more for the upcoming expac for an even faster prog clear time (let's shoot for fast kill together).

We are looking for someone with previous early prog experience (multiple w1s a strong plus) who values consistency, is adaptable when it comes to trying different strats/ideas, a team player, and above all else remains chill and never loses sight of the goal: to clear ASAP. 

If any of this interests you, please feel free to reach out with an intro.

Thanks!

P.S.: We also happen to be adding to our 9th man roster for anyone interested in potentially 9th manning.

WEEK 2 or WEEK 3 at the very most.

LF:  :sge: :sch:    1  Shield Healer // 

 ⏰ Schedule: (Time shows up @ your local time)
Monday: 11:00 PM to 2:00 AM
Tuesday: 11:00 PM to 2:00 AM
Wednesday: 11:00 PM to 2:00 AM
Thursday: 11:00 PM to 2:00 AM

:Mentor: About us:
Our team is made up from players from NA that speak English & Spanish, all of us have cleared the Endwalker Savage tiers at most at Week 3 solely on PF, as well we cleared DSR together as a group with the exception of 2 members. 

The group values a lot consistency over parse mentality, making little to no mistakes once we have learned the mechanics as a whole, but during the prog process we strive to help our members in need so that they may excel in their learning for swift reclearing.

:dead~1: Due to work issues and IRL, we decided a decent goal would be a Week 2, pushing until at the very latest week 3.

:msq: What are we looking for:

1- Punctuality, be sure that you will be able to stick to the established schedule by all means.
2- Have the necessary gear for DPS Checks (This means Full Crafted Set with optimal Pentamelds, food, and HQ Pots)
3- Play the job you're most comfortable with and you feel the certainity you can play at a high degree.
4- Ultimate experience is not needed BUT we will take priority in applicants who have cleared DSR/TOP.
5- Voice call is absolutely mandatory, even if you cannot speak, you must be there to listen to the callouts and instructions.
6- Strong focus on execution capability as this won't be blind prog, resources will be used (POV's, Streams, Raidplans.)

If you're interested, DM me (kain7292) - individual logs of our members available upon request. :frog~1:

[Static][HC][LFM][7.X] LF > Melee 

Group
We are a long-term hardcore group composed of experienced players who have played for too long. The group focuses on week one and early ultimate clears with a little dabbling of other activities to keep our skill level up. We hope to find like-minded individuals with the same goals and drive.

We are looking for a skilled & motivated melee :melee: to fill our roster for all future content. Ideally, you fit all the criteria laid out below. Having an alt is mandatory as we will be doing split clears.

Preferences

    Punctuality & personal accountability
    Maturity to receive and give criticism
    Must be flexible in your role
    Week one experience & ultimate experience


Schedule
For week one expect 8+ hour days til clear. The group will not have a confirmed schedule til the group is filled, but we will not be alarm clocking. As for a regular schedule, you can expect 4-12 hours per week depending on our goals. Our current start time post-prog is 5 pm PST. The schedule can and will be adjusted as needed.

If you are interested DM boup with your logs & any additional details.

[LFM][Aether][Mc-sHc][Savage][Ultimate][7/8][7.0]
We are a long time friend group of 5 looking for long term friends to game with and fill our roster for next expansion. We have raided multiple tiers of savage together, and are looking for more friends to join us long term for future savage and ultimate content.

With the following schedule, we're aiming to clear the tier in 2-3 weeks

Schedule
Week 1 & 2: Tue-Sat 6:00 PM - 11:00 PM
Weeks 3+: Tue/Wed 6:00 PM - 10:00 PM

Who are we?
We like to partake in memes and friendly banter, but above all else we are always there to help each other out. We dive logs and analyze how we can improve individually, and as a group. We log in almost daily to do all manner of content together, and often even play other games together during down time.
Our current roster is: 2 :Tank:  2 :melee: 1 :caster: 1 :ranged:  1 :sch: 

We're looking for
New friends that are looking for more than 1 tier or to raid log
Enthusiastic about learning and improving, able to give and take constructive criticisms when needed
Passionate about the following roles: 1 :ast: :whm: 

Expectations:
Laid back environment: We like to make memes and joke around during pulls, but we buckle down during new mechanics and help each other understand and progress as quickly as possible
Raid mindset: We are somewhat hardcore in how we approach things like efficiency with loot, improving personal performance, and prioritizing prog over parsing. When it comes to learning fights, mistakes are expected, however when bosses are on farm repeated mistakes will be analyzed and met with constructive communication to help players understand what is going wrong.
Respectful: We understand that this is a game, however we are raiding with structured times and expect consistent attendance and punctuality as well as focus for the duration of the raid time. There isn't room to accommodate frequent impromptu breaks, or step backs in prog and loot for repeated last minute absences. That being said, it is understandable that life is messy and things come up. We simply ask for transparency when substitutes may be needed.


If you are interested or have any questions about the group feel free to DM me at anytime.

[LFM][NA][Tank][Static] LF Tank for Finishing P12S and Beyond


Hey all! We're currently looking for a tank to round out our roster for Dawntrail. The plan is to finish up P12S and then move forward into new content in Dawntrail, possibly ultimates. We are a varied roster experience wise, between ultimates and savages, but we try to focus on having a good time first, and clearing content at a close second!

Our current schedule is Tues/Thurs/Sun 9:45 PM - 11:00 PM, but most likely this time will be extended on one end to allow for more prog time.

Requirements:

    A fun attitude! Good vibes are a must. We're here to have fun (and kill bosses).
    Ability to sit in voice chat (talking preferred but not required)
    Decent knowledge of your job and resources
    Ability to take constructive criticism and shrug off mistakes. We are laid back and focused on solutions, and we have open discussions about mistakes to solve them efficiently.


Please DM me if interested!

Looking for all roles:

Current lineup

:Tank:  / :melee:
:Tank:  / :caster:
:whm:

Raid Days & Time: 15 min break at half
Tuesday, Wednesday, & Thursday
7:00 PM - 10:00 PM
Converted to your time

While we look forward to having fun, please be considerate of others’ time. 

    Prog oriented mindset
    Not blind prog
    Study beforehand / Ask Questions
    Previous Savage experience is preferred
    Communication
        VC required. Utilizing mic is optional
    Punctuality
        Life happens but if repeatedly late; find another group
    IRL > Game
    If you plan to prog/clear; do so after raid schedule
        Don’t mess up loot for others
    Most importantly, be a positive human being
        People make mistakes
            It's just a game


Again, here to have fun and clear the tier in a timely manner. If the group desires and vibes well, we can push onto Ultimates afterwards. Will hold trials in TEA for vibe checks because I love TEA. Don’t know the fight? Study up buttercup.

About the group. 
LGBT+ Friendly group. Three friends who have been raiding together for a long time now. Both in savage and ultimates. We also have people who enjoy streaming. We like to make uwu jokes and enjoy conversing with one another. Comms may get chatty but when we need to get serious, I’ll ask for comms to stay quiet. Oh. If you don’t like soundboards… probably might not like this group. Or just silence it. Post is getting too long but if you want our logs lmk. While I don’t care about parses, I still want to know if you’ve cleared a tier on patch. Please send me your logs and the role you’re interested in.

[7.0][LFM][Casual][Blind][5/8]

Looking for 1 :Tank: and 2 :heal:

Hello friends! Are you interested in blind Savage raiding, but don’t have the time and/or energy for Week 1 raiding? Then this might be the group for you. We are looking to start a static for DT  focused on learning the raids blind on more casual hours.

When will we raid?
Two of M, W, or Th starting around 11:00 PM  and going for 2 lockouts with a short break.

What kind of person would be a good fit?

    Someone with a good attitude toward prog and learning the fights blind. Staying chill and positive will be necessary.
    Be ready for the fights and know your job. This is a casual group, but we still want to move forward consistently.  Jokes and silly pulls are fine, but we still want to be serious on the whole.
    Show up on time and ready to raid, consistently. Once we’ve decided on an exact date/time show up with the proper gear, food, pots. Respect everyone’s time. Life happens, so if you can’t make it on a certain night, we’ll understand, but it should be an exception.
    Respect the blind experience. No guides or other spoilers. If that’s a dealbreaker, then this might not be the group for you.
    Participate in the strategizing. You don’t need to be the most gregarious person, but you will need to be in the voice chat for call outs. We’d also love folks who have an eye for details and will chip in on the theory-crafting.


Who are the current members?
We’re folks who enjoy raiding and want to blind raid in DT, but also don’t have the time to join hardcore groups. We have varying Savage-level experience, so don't feel like you can't join up if you don't have much
Our current roster is:

    SMN
    RDM/VPR
    MNK
    DNC
    PLD (flexible)


 Thanks for your time!

[LFM][Tank][Dawntrail][Savage][Arcadion][MC-sHC][7/8] :Tank: 

We are a cross-DC static looking for an off-tank for the upcoming Arcadion Savage raid series in Dawntrail. Our goal is to clear the current savage content relatively quickly (12 hours per week) and secure BiS before Eden Ultimate comes out. Prog pace is anticipated to be 1-2 months, given that we can't accurately predict the difficulty of the raid tier. Participation in the upcoming ultimate is not required, as I will be organizing that as a separate static.

Expectations Overview:

-At least one of the following: Ultimate (Not UWU) clear > Criterion Savage clear > Multiple On-patch savage clears
-Strong understanding of previous raid mechanics and terminology (to avoid mental stack overload)
-Preparation for fight mechs by researching footage, creating diagrams/toolboxes
-Microphone
(additional details will be shared upon inquiry)

[Aether][7.0 Blind Savage / 7.1 Blind Ulti][LFM][6/8]

BLIND week 1 group looking for some experienced/very skilled players to join for the upcoming savage and future content

Looking for 2x :heal: 

6+hr, every day, week1
Schedule: 
Mon-Fri: 9:00 PM - 3:00 AM
Weekends: 10+hr/d with a break (hours TBA)

We are an HC static of very experienced players and are looking to find similar mindset players for the upcoming savage/future content.
About you: Very friendly person with chill vibes (most important) and strong prog mindset as in able to focus on recovery/adjustability to further progression and strong consistency. Understanding the mesh between progression mentality and friendly mentality is a must (one cannot exist without the other). You should be very confident in your skills. Understanding what entails an intelligent raid mindset is an incredibly important skill that should be expected of you.

Ideal experience (If you can demonstrate proof of skill, some can be waived) to match the players currently in the group:
TOP/DSR on patch
At least 3 savage tiers cleared on patch, with proof of ability to optimize for first clear
Raid-lead mental (mental APM to be aware of multiple players at once rather than just yourself)
Mechanically, you should have the confidence to one or two-shot most mechanics (especially savage)
Including the above, consistency for a mechanic should be ensured within a couple tries (your mentality should reflect how you approach performing a mechanic in the most robust way possible)
While not required, blind exp is a plus.
Ideally no usage of AM/Sim or dependency

About us: 
Everyone is extremely friendly/chill and behave like educated adults (no drama bs). Most/Everyone are pentas, having cleared TOP/DSR (on patch), and every savage tier since edens verse. We cleared all of EW savage full blind. Also, we casually blinded ASSS (2d, 4h/d), w30th, AAIS, w37th.

Dm for logs if interested!

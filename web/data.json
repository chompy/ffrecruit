Many of the ideals of this FC are rooted in that old school MMO mentality, specifically FFXI. (By that I mean the camaraderie aspects...not the grinding crabs for 6 hours to gain a single level aspects... >.>)\n\n* We are forever a small FC. We seek just enough active members to balance being able to do full party affairs semi-regularly while being small enough for people to regularly play with each other and form meaningful connections. \n\n* We are not a RP FC, but we have several members who enjoy RP. To speak for myself specifically, I thoroughly enjoy lore and immersion - thus I tend to enjoy interacting with RP'ers. To put all that in a practical sense: don't expect any FC RP events, but if you like to RP and be in character, we'll certainly be accepting.\n\n* Everyone in the FC is a working adult with other things going on outside of the game.\n\n* Our activities, particularly our weekly event[s], usually occur around 9pm Eastern Time and end around 11:00pm.\n\n* Newbie Friendly\n\n* We make use of Discord for out of game communication. Voice chat is never required, but to offer full disclosure...at this point, everyone uses it during our weekly events. Though your right to remain silent or to listen to the music over people bantering (I often do that myself much to the annoyance of some \\^\\^) will be protected if that is your preference.\n\n\n**Now that the basic bits are out of the way, let me get to what actually defines us!**\n\n* **Casual Mindset:** It doesn't matter how much you play the game, what matters is how you *approach* the game. No one here cares about your gear, rotation, skill, etc. You're a person and a member of the community - not a dps number, an item level, or a vulnerability stack number. The point is to get together and have *fun* doing whatever it is we're doing as a team. Not competing, judging, or playing to an external standard.\n\n  We'll run 4-man roulettes with no healer, we'll stack jobs however we want in an 8 man affair, we'll have the person who just hit 90 on Scholar via MSQ roulettes heal the latest level 90 ex trial. It doesn't matter, as long as we're having fun together while getting to experience the game. \\^_\\^ We also never watch fight videos and generally come up with our own strategies for dealing with various attacks as we experience them. Strategies that usually involve the least amount of preset coordination, markers, and rigidness as possible(read: none). You know, panic enough times trying to spread out death circles on the fly without waymarks and assignments and you actually get rather good at it. \n\n* **Shared Experience:** We strive to do things together. Given the reality of modern MMOs, this largely refers to raids and extreme trials as MSQ and weekly progression forces you into doing everything else as a routine. \n\n  When a new raid (8 man or 24 man) comes out, everyone waits to do it together for the first time (whenever schedules align during the patch week). In that same vein, when a new ex trial comes out, no one touches it until we can do it together as a full FC party. Be it the week of, after a few weeks, or after a few months depending on our activity backlog and scheduling issues. Really, few tend to do them alone even after we beat them either - we like to stick together and always aim to help each other out with goals (*cough, mounts and glamour*). Plus we usually come up with such sub-optimal, oddball strategies that we'd be clueless as to the general PF strategy. XD \n\n* **\"Slow Burn:\"** This one doesn't really refer to a principle as much as it refers to a reality of who we are. If you're someone looking for constant activity in game, a frenetic Discord chat throughout the day, and to push through content quickly... we are *most definitely* not the group for you. \n\n  We are a small FC. We are a FC of people with other priorities. We are a FC of people who enjoy the game at a rather leisurely pace. That type of activity isn't happening here outside of expansion release periods. :P \n\n  *What do we offer then?* A comfortable, low key environment where you can go about your affairs while being part of a group of friends. A group that offers people in Discord who you can ask \"hey, anyone want to do a leveling roulette tonight?\" and have companions who share your mindset. A group of people who can help you out with crafts (or be helped out, nothing like the skills being needed ;) ). Companions that you can join every week to do maps, farm older mounts, take on an old raid sync'd down, or bang against the newest Ex trial in a low pressure environment amongst friends. A group that (thus far) will stay together over time as no one is burning themselves out by trying to do everything *now* or by being burdened with overwhelming in-game commitments. \n\nDon't know if I achieved my desired conciseness here... but all that is the stuff that really matters, no? Who we are, what we do, and how we do it. \\^\\^\n\n\n\nIf we sound like an FC you would want to be part of, feel free to DM me on Discord (cyruance), or /tell me in game (Draco Cyrancia).

I myself (Siegfried) tend to write out entire boss timelines as fights go live with brief descriptions of mechanics to provide an early edge for my own use to learn fights and will gladly provide them. We also are aware there are people who do not even touch endgame and prefer the more laxed stuff like crafting and gathering, dedicated channels have been made in our discord for so the discussions can be separated based on your needs. We have our own large mansion In the Lavender Beds: Plot 28, Ward 25. As we are in the middle of restructuring at the moment we are planning to front the money for everyone's FC rooms.\n\nGeneral Policies \n\n1. We will not tolerate extreme Elitism, Usage of parsing as a means to bully other players will result in immediate termination. Parsing should be used as a self improvement tool not as a measuring stick for one's ego to diminish others.\n\n2.

I'm interested in joining a serious speeds or opti group for 7.0+. To clarify, this group would be separate from my prog static/obligations, as I'm still committed to Neverland/the world race.\n\nFor people who aren't familiar with me - I've been doing raid optimization in this game since Heavensward. I'm well versed in using theorycrafting tools, such as spreadsheets and raid sims, and am more than comfortable with doing my own theorycrafting/finding optimal rotations (and I believe I've demonstrated this consistently over the years). I also regularly discuss theorycraft and other ideas with multiple other top players, and have even assisted others in the past with their own planning for speeds or parsing. If needed, I can help provide information or tools that may prove useful as well.\n\nI'd mostly be interested in playing the caster role, and can play/theorycraft for any of the jobs needed. And I'll obviously be committing time to properly theorycrafting Pictomancer as well, if that job is ever useful in an opti setting.\n\nI don't mind doing either speeds or parsing, my expectations are to compete for rank 1 regardless of what I do. I just wanna use my brain and get funny numbers like others do :)\n\nAlso, if anyone cares to know this, I also have been apart of multiple top world prog groups as well, which I think should speak to my mechanical consistency too.\n\nI can play in any region, as I currently maintain characters in NA, EU, and JP.\n\nI can provide various ranking examples from myself over the years below.

We usually have a another game server up during content lulls, and play recently released games together. Some of the servers include Minecraft and Conan Exiles. We are a smaller community of people who have been playing games together for 6+ years and look forward to meeting you. Our focus is to prioritize fun in content and to not take anything too seriously as most of us work day jobs and would rather not have that MMO that is a second job when we get home.\n\nWe have a VERY active Discord. As much as we would love to chat with you in game, most of the conversations happen in Discord in Voice and Chat. We even have a dedicated Crossworld linkshell for people who would like to join in the voice chat but would rather type while keeping their mic muted. Most of our members use discord to keep in touch or ask for help so please sign up!

Because of this, we put a focus on the players more than strictly content. While we want to experience all there is that the game has to offer, we want to do it with friends.\n\n**Our Goals**  \nAs we are a new FC and filled with players of varying experience, our main focus will be to get our members familiar with one another, build friendships, and build up the Free Company to fit our community.  \nAs we grow, we will look to start setting up more FC events, community events, roleplay, giveaways, raid statics, and more! Keep in mind that this will take TIME.\n\nWe will also be looking to promote members within to be leaders in the various forms of content FFXIV has to offer. If this is something you would be interested in doing, whether it be savage content or community events, let us know, and we will equip you for the job.\n\n**Savage Raiding & Ultimates (Optional)**  \nWe plan to try to get 1-2 statics set up for Dawntrail, but would love to be able to start clearing some of the Endwalker and older raids for those who haven't done them yet. We will start with this first team and expand to multiple teams as we grow.\n\n**Our first Static Raid Schedule will be as follows:**  \nThursday: 07:30pm - 10:00pm CST  \nFriday: 07:30pm - 10:00pm CST  \n\\*for progression we may attempt +30 minutes if players all want to push.\n\n**Recruitment**  \nIf you are looking for a fresh FC and want to get in on the ground floor of something new, we could be the home for you. We aim to form a tight-knit group of people who not only enjoy killing bosses together but can enjoy hanging out during the week in discord whether in-game or not.\n\nWe are open to new, returning, or veteran players of any experience level.  \nIf this sounds like something you would be interested in, you can do any of the following:\n\n1.

No matter what game we play, we have a great time playing with great friends and are looking for more to join us here in FFXIV.\r  \n\r  \nAlthough we might have met in wow, in FFXIV we have people of all skill levels ranging from seasoned vets to fresh sprouts and have been spending this time before Dawntrail experiencing everything the game has to offer. We have recently pushed through pandaemonium savage prog and with that taste of end-game, we are absolutely stoked to hit the ground running on launch. Our statics are still taking shape and we hope to have several going strong once we all finish the new MSQ.\r  \n\r  \nBut beyond end-game content, we all just love playing this game together. We\u2019ve gone back and run old raids and extreme trials, both synced and unsynced. We run maps, do our rolos, go clubbing and everything in between. We also have a beautiful house in Lavender Beds with a fantastic herd of loporrit attendees.\r  \n\r  \nWe\u2019re not a giant FC and have no desire to be. We recruit for people, not for numbers so those we have all make a big impact. We are comfortably active and have people on most times through a variety of time zones. It\u2019s not uncommon to find people chilling in voice coms just looking to chat and hang out. We even have a strong Work From Home community for all those daytime warriors.\r  \n\r  \nIf you\u2019re looking for a chill community of players and want to join us as we prepare for the New World, I\u2019d love to chat!\r  \n\r  \nHit me up on Discord:\r  \n\r  \nKeskora\r  \n\r  \nTastyy09\r  \n\r  \nhttps://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/community\\_finder/273aa807af9b884e72741cc84e5cb593959ba889/", "original_id": "1cjzk9m", "schedule": "Various, with people on most times through a variety of time zones.

Because of this, we put a focus on the players more than strictly content. While we want to experience all there is that the game has to offer, we want to do it with friends.\n\n\n\n**Our Goals**\n\nAs we are a new FC and filled with players of varying experience, our main focus will be to get our members familiar with one another, build friendships, and build up the Free Company to fit our community.\n\nAs we grow, we will look to start setting up more FC events, community events, roleplay, giveaways, raid statics, and more! Keep in mind that this will take TIME.\n\nWe will also be looking to promote members within to be leaders in the various forms of content FFXIV has to offer. If this is something you would be interested in doing, whether it be savage content or community events, let us know, and we will equip you for the job.\n\n\n\n**Savage Raiding & Ultimates (Optional)**\n\nWe plan to try to get 1-2 statics set up for Dawntrail, but would love to be able to start clearing some of the Endwalker and older raids for those who haven't done them yet. We will start with this first team and expand to multiple teams as we grow.\n\n\n\n**Our first Static Raid Schedule will be as follows:**\n\nThursday: 07:30pm - 10:00pm CST\n\nFriday: 07:30pm - 10:00pm CST\n\n\\*for progression we may attempt +30 minutes if players all want to push.\n\n\n\n**Recruitment**\n\nIf you are looking for a fresh FC and want to get in on the ground floor of something new, we could be the home for you. We aim to form a tight-knit group of people who not only enjoy killing bosses together but can enjoy hanging out during the week in discord whether in-game or not.\n\n\n\nWe are open to new, returning, or veteran players of any experience level.\n\nIf this sounds like something you would be interested in, you can do any of the following:\n\n\n\n1.

We have a casual timeslot but we aim to clear/farm the tier then have fun returning to old content or attempting ultimates.\n\nSkill and experience in your role are preferred, but not required as long as you're willing to listen and learn. Experience raiding is highly requested but I'm willing to talk it out if you're new to savage. In the end, a game is a game and people have to learn somewhere.\n\nDiscord and voice is a must. Preferably speaking people but as long as you can listen is good enough. \n\nOur server is, for the most part, chill enough and welcome to all sorts. People will respect boundaries and beliefs but an ability to take a joke and roll with punches is definitely required all the same. Additionally, the ability to speak up and talk to people calmly if there does become a problem is a must. We should all be adults here.\n\nOther than that, we're just a bunch of getting-old farts looking for more good times raiding.

I am looking for a WP group for the upcoming Dawntrail expansion. Currently I am a melee DPS player but I am willing to play other DPS roles or pick up Healing as well. I am looking for a long-term group that is interested in racing both savages and ultimates and is aiming to improve and work towards placing top 10 or better throughout 7.0. \n\nA little about myself: I started playing at the start of ShB and joined an FC static in Eden's Verse. I have been clearing savage week 1 consistently since then. I have cleared all Ultimates with TEA/DSR/TOP on content with midcore hours. I have alarm clocked and done HC hours for all savage tiers during EW with my best current placement being World 30th for Anabaseios last tier with a new group that I joined. I also did week 1 another aloala island savage with some friends which was a ton of fun!\n\nCurrent Raid History\n\n* Week 1 savage clears since Eden's Verse\n* Week 4 TEA \n* Week 4 DSR\n* Week 8 TOP\n* World 30th for Anabaseios\n* Day 5 Another Aloala Island Savage\n\nI am able to play any role needed at a high level after some practice, with my most comfort being DPS, specifically melee. Considering the upcoming new expansion and time before next tier, I am willing to learn and practice Healing or another DPS role that would fit best with my future group. I would consider myself consistent during prog and am able to play for long hours while staying focused. I am very fast at learning mechanics and am able to communicate effectively with the group while being receptive of criticism. I am also comfortable shotcalling if needed and have experience coming up with strats/diagrams and making mitigation sheets for my previous statics. \n\nMy Ideal Group\n\n* Long term commitment to preparing for raid tiers and performing our best during raid\n* Ability to alarm clock for racing and take PTO as necessary\n* Previous alarm clock/racing/HC experience \n* Ability to optimize and flex jobs within your role\n* Consistent gameplay, ability to adapt, and strong mental during prog\n* Overall positive vibes and ability to find enjoyment raiding in the game\n* Alts for splits for faster gearing and desires to speedkill and optimize after week 1 would be optimal but not required\n\n\nI primarily play this game to enjoy new raiding content and to complete it as fast as possible. As new raid content is few and far in between, I am looking for a group of players that shares this sentiment. An ideal group for me would share my drive to improve and be willing to put in the time and effort to place high in upcoming races.

We spent time designing rules, leaving spaces for hard topics, and building a place for people to be completely human.\r  \nWe have a weekly and monthly schedule, we have occasional movie nights together, and we talk about exercise and mental/physical health in our discord- we want to recognize the humans behind the screens as well as the fun of the game. \r  \nWe are open to all kinds of players! Our crew does a little of everything, and we love giving space for folks to enjoy the game no matter what their focus is.

We enjoy PVP, treasure maps, Blue Mage, Eureka, deep dungeons, you name it!\r  \n\r  \nMiddling sized FC, no plans to be a huge mega FC- we recruit slowly and try to give you time in our discord to \"try us out\" before pulling you in.

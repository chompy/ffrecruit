When it comes to learning fights, mistakes are expected, however when bosses are on farm repeated mistakes will be analyzed and met with constructive communication to help players understand what is going wrong.\n    Respectful: We understand that this is a game, however we are raiding with structured times and expect consistent attendance and punctuality as well as focus for the duration of the raid time. There isn't room to accommodate frequent impromptu breaks, or step backs in prog and loot for repeated last minute absences. That being said, it is understandable that life is messy and things come up. We simply ask for transparency when substitutes may be needed.\n\n\n\nIf you are interested or have any questions about the group feel free to DM me at anytime.

I have been clearing savage week 1 consistently since then. I have cleared all Ultimates with TEA/DSR/TOP on content with midcore hours. I have alarm clocked and done HC hours for all savage tiers during EW with my best current placement being World 30th for Anabaseios last tier with a new group that I joined.

Considering the upcoming new expansion and time before next tier, I am willing to learn and practice Healing or another DPS role that would fit best with my future group. I would consider myself consistent during prog and am able to play for long hours while staying focused. I am very fast at learning mechanics and am able to communicate effectively with the group while being receptive of criticism. I am also comfortable shotcalling if needed and have experience coming up with strats/diagrams and making mitigation sheets for my previous statics. \n\nMy Ideal Group\n\n* Long term commitment to preparing for raid tiers and performing our best during raid\n* Ability to alarm clock for racing and take PTO as necessary\n* Previous alarm clock/racing/HC experience \n* Ability to optimize and flex jobs within your role\n* Consistent gameplay, ability to adapt, and strong mental during prog\n* Overall positive vibes and ability to find enjoyment raiding in the game\n* Alts for splits for faster gearing and desires to speedkill and optimize after week 1 would be optimal but not required\n\n\nI primarily play this game to enjoy new raiding content and to complete it as fast as possible. As new raid content is few and far in between, I am looking for a group of players that shares this sentiment. An ideal group for me would share my drive to improve and be willing to put in the time and effort to place high in upcoming races.

I cleared the last tier quite a bit later due to life circumstances. I have ultimate and criterion savage experience having clears on UWU, UCOB, TEA, ASSS, and AAIS.

Our crew does a little of everything, and we love giving space for folks to enjoy the game no matter what their focus is.

I'm interested in joining a serious speeds or opti group for 7.0+. To clarify, this group would be separate from my prog static/obligations, as I'm still committed to Neverland/the world race.\n\nFor people who aren't familiar with me - I've been doing raid optimization in this game since Heavensward. I'm well versed in using theorycrafting tools, such as spreadsheets and raid sims, and am more than comfortable with doing my own theorycrafting/finding optimal rotations (and I believe I've demonstrated this consistently over the years). I also regularly discuss theorycraft and other ideas with multiple other top players, and have even assisted others in the past with their own planning for speeds or parsing. If needed, I can help provide information or tools that may prove useful as well.\n\nI'd mostly be interested in playing the caster role, and can play/theorycraft for any of the jobs needed. And I'll obviously be committing time to properly theorycrafting Pictomancer as well, if that job is ever useful in an opti setting.\n\nI don't mind doing either speeds or parsing, my expectations are to compete for rank 1 regardless of what I do. I just wanna use my brain and get funny numbers like others do :)\n\nAlso, if anyone cares to know this, I also have been apart of multiple top world prog groups as well, which I think should speak to my mechanical consistency too.\n\nI can play in any region, as I currently maintain characters in NA, EU, and JP.\n\nI can provide various ranking examples from myself over the years below.

We don't have a previous core, and we are looking to build something new from the ground up!***\n\n**About Us**  \nWe are a new Free Company and community forming on Primal - Exodus for Endwalker, Dawntrail, future expansions, and other games.\n\nOur aim is to build a new FC truly built around community; however, we do believe a community's strongest point is social interaction. Because of this, we put a focus on the players more than strictly content. While we want to experience all there is that the game has to offer, we want to do it with friends.\n\n**Our Goals**  \nAs we are a new FC and filled with players of varying experience, our main focus will be to get our members familiar with one another, build friendships, and build up the Free Company to fit our community.  \nAs we grow, we will look to start setting up more FC events, community events, roleplay, giveaways, raid statics, and more! Keep in mind that this will take TIME.\n\nWe will also be looking to promote members within to be leaders in the various forms of content FFXIV has to offer. If this is something you would be interested in doing, whether it be savage content or community events, let us know, and we will equip you for the job.\n\n**Savage Raiding & Ultimates (Optional)**  \nWe plan to try to get 1-2 statics set up for Dawntrail, but would love to be able to start clearing some of the Endwalker and older raids for those who haven't done them yet. We will start with this first team and expand to multiple teams as we grow.\n\n**Our first Static Raid Schedule will be as follows:**  \nThursday: 07:30pm - 10:00pm CST  \nFriday: 07:30pm - 10:00pm CST  \n\\*for progression we may attempt +30 minutes if players all want to push.\n\n**Recruitment**  \nIf you are looking for a fresh FC and want to get in on the ground floor of something new, we could be the home for you. We aim to form a tight-knit group of people who not only enjoy killing bosses together but can enjoy hanging out during the week in discord whether in-game or not.\n\nWe are open to new, returning, or veteran players of any experience level.  \nIf this sounds like something you would be interested in, you can do any of the following:\n\n1.

After my first clear I re-progged the fight on dragoon, and it took me about 1 week to get to p6 meteors. I have not cleared yet on dragoon because my school has been a little bit more intense this semester.\n\nI will have PTO for the first set of savage raids, and I will not be in class.

Many of the ideals of this FC are rooted in that old school MMO mentality, specifically FFXI. (By that I mean the camaraderie aspects...not the grinding crabs for 6 hours to gain a single level aspects... >.>)\n\n* We are forever a small FC. We seek just enough active members to balance being able to do full party affairs semi-regularly while being small enough for people to regularly play with each other and form meaningful connections. \n\n* We are not a RP FC, but we have several members who enjoy RP. To speak for myself specifically, I thoroughly enjoy lore and immersion - thus I tend to enjoy interacting with RP'ers. To put all that in a practical sense: don't expect any FC RP events, but if you like to RP and be in character, we'll certainly be accepting.\n\n* Everyone in the FC is a working adult with other things going on outside of the game.\n\n* Our activities, particularly our weekly event[s], usually occur around 9pm Eastern Time and end around 11:00pm.\n\n* Newbie Friendly\n\n* We make use of Discord for out of game communication. Voice chat is never required, but to offer full disclosure...at this point, everyone uses it during our weekly events. Though your right to remain silent or to listen to the music over people bantering (I often do that myself much to the annoyance of some \\^\\^) will be protected if that is your preference.\n\n\n**Now that the basic bits are out of the way, let me get to what actually defines us!**\n\n* **Casual Mindset:** It doesn't matter how much you play the game, what matters is how you *approach* the game. No one here cares about your gear, rotation, skill, etc. You're a person and a member of the community - not a dps number, an item level, or a vulnerability stack number. The point is to get together and have *fun* doing whatever it is we're doing as a team. Not competing, judging, or playing to an external standard.\n\n  We'll run 4-man roulettes with no healer, we'll stack jobs however we want in an 8 man affair, we'll have the person who just hit 90 on Scholar via MSQ roulettes heal the latest level 90 ex trial. It doesn't matter, as long as we're having fun together while getting to experience the game. \\^_\\^ We also never watch fight videos and generally come up with our own strategies for dealing with various attacks as we experience them. Strategies that usually involve the least amount of preset coordination, markers, and rigidness as possible(read: none). You know, panic enough times trying to spread out death circles on the fly without waymarks and assignments and you actually get rather good at it. \n\n* **Shared Experience:** We strive to do things together. Given the reality of modern MMOs, this largely refers to raids and extreme trials as MSQ and weekly progression forces you into doing everything else as a routine. \n\n  When a new raid (8 man or 24 man) comes out, everyone waits to do it together for the first time (whenever schedules align during the patch week). In that same vein, when a new ex trial comes out, no one touches it until we can do it together as a full FC party. Be it the week of, after a few weeks, or after a few months depending on our activity backlog and scheduling issues. Really, few tend to do them alone even after we beat them either - we like to stick together and always aim to help each other out with goals (*cough, mounts and glamour*). Plus we usually come up with such sub-optimal, oddball strategies that we'd be clueless as to the general PF strategy. XD \n\n* **\"Slow Burn:\"** This one doesn't really refer to a principle as much as it refers to a reality of who we are. If you're someone looking for constant activity in game, a frenetic Discord chat throughout the day, and to push through content quickly... we are *most definitely* not the group for you. \n\n  We are a small FC. We are a FC of people with other priorities. We are a FC of people who enjoy the game at a rather leisurely pace. That type of activity isn't happening here outside of expansion release periods. :P \n\n  *What do we offer then?* A comfortable, low key environment where you can go about your affairs while being part of a group of friends. A group that offers people in Discord who you can ask \"hey, anyone want to do a leveling roulette tonight?\" and have companions who share your mindset. A group of people who can help you out with crafts (or be helped out, nothing like the skills being needed ;) ). Companions that you can join every week to do maps, farm older mounts, take on an old raid sync'd down, or bang against the newest Ex trial in a low pressure environment amongst friends. A group that (thus far) will stay together over time as no one is burning themselves out by trying to do everything *now* or by being burdened with overwhelming in-game commitments. \n\nDon't know if I achieved my desired conciseness here... but all that is the stuff that really matters, no? Who we are, what we do, and how we do it. \\^\\^\n\n\n\nIf we sound like an FC you would want to be part of, feel free to DM me on Discord (cyruance), or /tell me in game (Draco Cyrancia).

These adventurers come from all walks of life, each with their own unique skills and tales of overcoming insurmountable odds.*\n\n*Their headquarters is a place of wonder, adorned with trophies and relics from their most daring exploits. The walls are etched with stories of their greatest Limit Breaks, moments when they defied the very limits of their abilities to turn the tide of battle.*\n\n*The Limit Breakers are not just warriors; they are innovators and strategists, constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible. They specialize in tackling the impossible, whether it's conquering the toughest raids or facing down the might of Primal Enemies.*\n\n*Their motto, \"Beyond the Brink of Darkness, we are the Mightiest Light\" encapsulates their philosophy. They train not only their bodies but also their minds and spirits to break past their limits when it matters most. Their bond is their greatest strength, as they channel their collective will to unleash devastating power.*\n\n*Each member carries a crystal, a symbol of their commitment to the company and each other. When they assemble, their combined strength can shatter the barriers of reality, allowing them to perform feats that become the stuff of legends.*\n\nOur ideal community member will hold true to our motto belief system and the honor code. ABOVE ALL a member will be themselves, genuinely and fully.\n\nSince we are adults sometimes it gets a little too busy irl and people take breaks. Sometimes members will play something else for a while. (we also really enjoy resident evil lol) And that's perfectly fine by us.

After some time away from FFXIV, I am excited for Dawntrail and Pictomancer and am slowly filling the ranks of our FC.\n\nWe are looking for more members to build a solid core. This is a casual, family-type leveling social guild. Eventually, if we get the players to form teams and enough people want to branch out into other content, we can more than handle it. We have more than a few veteran players of FFXIV and other MMOs as well\n\n.So, if you are a new player on Gilgamesh, Just got the game on XBOX, a veteran player without a home, or even a new player to the game (sprout) - give us a try! Also, if you are just a number in your current guild, or just want a fresh start... you are more than welcome here. :) As a founding member of the rebuild, you can help shape the way the guild grows. Also, WoW refugees are more than welcome, as I was once a WoW player and I see many refugees in-game.\n\nEven though the FC is rebuilding, we DO have the perks! We have a large house in Ishgard located in Plot 30, 18 Ward, Empyreum. We are ranked 30, so we have buffs, gardens, Murder Bird (Chocobo) stables, etc. We also have a discord set up and running. Feel free to hang out there, even if you decide not to join the FC in-game. We would love to build a strong community there as well.\n\nHit me (A'rora Nightfall) or any other officer up in-game or you may apply in-game through the FC finder tool.

While we want to experience all there is that the game has to offer, we want to do it with friends.\n\n\n\n**Our Goals**\n\nAs we are a new FC and filled with players of varying experience, our main focus will be to get our members familiar with one another, build friendships, and build up the Free Company to fit our community.\n\nAs we grow, we will look to start setting up more FC events, community events, roleplay, giveaways, raid statics, and more! Keep in mind that this will take TIME.\n\nWe will also be looking to promote members within to be leaders in the various forms of content FFXIV has to offer. If this is something you would be interested in doing, whether it be savage content or community events, let us know, and we will equip you for the job.\n\n\n\n**Savage Raiding & Ultimates (Optional)**\n\nWe plan to try to get 1-2 statics set up for Dawntrail, but would love to be able to start clearing some of the Endwalker and older raids for those who haven't done them yet. We will start with this first team and expand to multiple teams as we grow.\n\n\n\n**Our first Static Raid Schedule will be as follows:**\n\nThursday: 07:30pm - 10:00pm CST\n\nFriday: 07:30pm - 10:00pm CST\n\n\\*for progression we may attempt +30 minutes if players all want to push.\n\n\n\n**Recruitment**\n\nIf you are looking for a fresh FC and want to get in on the ground floor of something new, we could be the home for you.

Our goal is to create a place for players of all walks can just nerd out and have fun with the game. We are NOT a hardcore raid focused FC, however we will try our best to facilitate any raid teams that come from the company with up to date guides and tools. I myself (Siegfried) tend to write out entire boss timelines as fights go live with brief descriptions of mechanics to provide an early edge for my own use to learn fights and will gladly provide them. We also are aware there are people who do not even touch endgame and prefer the more laxed stuff like crafting and gathering, dedicated channels have been made in our discord for so the discussions can be separated based on your needs. We have our own large mansion In the Lavender Beds: Plot 28, Ward 25. As we are in the middle of restructuring at the moment we are planning to front the money for everyone's FC rooms.\n\nGeneral Policies \n\n1. We will not tolerate extreme Elitism, Usage of parsing as a means to bully other players will result in immediate termination. Parsing should be used as a self improvement tool not as a measuring stick for one's ego to diminish others.\n\n2. Be kind to your fellow members, joking with one another with in group jokes/insults is fine but keep others who are not in on the jokes into consideration.\n\n3. Free Company Event Participation is not mandatory at all.\n\n4.

Set Friday or Saturday raid days aren't ideal since I will occasionally be travelling those days (every 6-8 weeks).\n\nWhat I bring to a group:\n\n* quick learner\n* consistent at mechanical execution\n* high level of raid awareness, i.e. spotting what went wrong, adjusting in the moment or finding details in mechanics\n* knowledge of job optimization to the highest levels\n* no problems acknowledging my own mistakes and finding ways to fix them in future pulls\n\nWhat I expect from a group:\n\n* Week 1 Savage clears, week 4-6 Ultimate clears\n* 2-4 raid days after prog, only doing reclears would also be ok\n* a constructive raid environment - mistakes should be acknowledged and fixed as a group effort but not be harped on\n* open and mature communication - no screaming at people, raging, shutting down etc., everybody should feel comfortable speaking up about perceived mistakes so they can be fixed\n\nMy main can be found under https://www.fflogs.com/character/id/13810028.\n\nI will have an alt ready for split clears if the group chooses to do them. \n\nI did not raid that much in the current tier. Took a break for around 6 months and have been getting back into it in preparation for Dawntrail now. Spent the time mythic raiding in wow so I have not been fully out of the mmorpg game.\n\nThe best way to reach me is in discord under schmali .

So, myself and two friends are looking to either join a pre-existing group for Dawntrail or bring people in to fill out a roster for the 7.01/2 savage as well as the Eden Ultimate. Planned raid times are 3-4 hours each on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, with start and end times being negotiable once we have the full group together. Here are our logs and Tomestone.ggs\r  \n\r  \n\\- Reaper: https://www.fflogs.com/character/na/leviathan/zero%20kurokami , https://tomestone.gg/character/29980237/zero-kurokami\r  \n\r  \n\\- Picto/Omnicaster: https://www.fflogs.com/character/na/leviathan/altaire%20q%27orani , https://tomestone.gg/character/30661841/altaire-qorani\r  \n\r  \n\\- PLD/Omnitank: https://www.fflogs.com/character/na/jenova/hen%20ro# , [https://tomestone.gg/character/18178328/hen-ro](https://tomestone.gg/character/18178328/hen-ro)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-DRG: \r  \n\r  \nThe reaper and caster are quadra-legends with the PLD being in phase 6 of DSR as of the posting of this message. We have midcore hours with a semi-hardcore mindset, being that we fully believe that raid members should take the initiative to come prepared to clear and, if they're having difficulty, take the time and effort to run simulators, hit up party finder, pull vods, or otherwise do whatever's needed aside from the usual courtesies of showing up on time with food/pots/etc. It's mostly that we're looking for a skilled group that isn't necessarily planning on spending every other night raiding for the sake of maintaining irl relationships. This isn't to say that we don't plan on enjoying ourselves and screwing around a bit, but making sure that the group has the same goals and approximate skill level is pretty important. \r  \n\r  \nThe reaper and caster cleared Anabaseios early week 5, so that's the target goal for the first raid tier of DT. Given that the first raid tier is usually easier than the others, it's likely that we'll clear sooner than that. Once savage is done, we plan on looking at the Eden Ultimate. Afterward, keeping the group together for subsequent tiers would be great, along with hangouts, mount farms, and such.

Wall of text incoming x)  \n   \n**About me**  \nI've started to play XIV and raid during 5.2. Cleared every upcoming tier (plus ShB Tier 1 min ilvl) while it was relevant (no echo, etc.). I've played all tanks, almost all melees, healer and a bit of caster/phys ranged in savage so far. I can play every role, but I had the most fun on DPS, so I would primarily like to play as such. For Dawntrail I would like to expand my experience and skillset with casters. Wouldn't mind to change to another DPS class for other tiers, if someone else wants to dabble in the art of magic. Also feel free to look through my logs, if you're interested: [https://www.fflogs.com/character/id/13908010](https://www.fflogs.com/character/id/13908010)  \nI am a fast learner (with mechanics and pickung up new classes) and more importantly I play very consistent. I have progged blind a few times, love to contribute to solving mechanics and like to make some toolbox/raidplaner visuals for my fellow static members. I also wouldn't mind raiding with guides.  \n\n\n**Values and expectations for the static**  \nMy biggest two values for a static are a) respecting each others time and b) communication.  \n*Regarding A:* Be on time, look up guides, get mentally ready to raid, have enough pots/food prepared and focus, etc.  \n*Regarding B:* Tell the static, if something is going to reduce your performance for an upcoming raid session. Examples: You'll be late? Let others know. You don't understand some mechanics? Let's talk about it and help each other out. You messed a mechanic up? Let the static know, so people don't need to overanalyze. While I prefer a relaxed atmosphere, I still wan't people to able to take critique and to talk about problems. Banging your head against a wall, cause someone didn't prepare for a fight or is otherwise distracted without letting anyone else know is highly frustrating. After all, everybody should have a good time and have fun.  \n\n\nA full savage clear shouldn't take longer than 8 weeks, leaving enough time to get BiS and having some buffer, before jumping into the next tier/ultimate.  \n\n\n**Availability**  \n3 times a week with \\~3 hour sessions.  \nI'm abailable every day between 7 pm - 11:30 pm (GMT+2).

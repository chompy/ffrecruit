    ## SCHEDULE
    The schedule of the player and/or their group, if provided. Not every message will have a schedule. Player's that are looking for members will often provide a schedule of when their group plays, whereas player's that are looking for a group will often provide a schedule of when they are available to play.

    If the group provides concrete days of the week and times then format it as follows...
    Week One Tuesday: 9:00 PM - 3:00 AM EST; Every Monday: 8:30 PM - 11:00 PM EST; Every Other Sunday: 3:00 PM - 7:30 PM EST

    Otherwise just sumarize their schedule the best you can, or leave this field blank if they make no mention of scheduling.

    ### EXAMPLES

    #### EXAMPLE 1
    **INPUT**
    ```
    We play every Wednesday from 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM EST. For week one we will also play on Tuesday from 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM EST.
    ```

    **OUTPUT**
    ```
    SCHEDULE:
    Every Wednesday: 9:00 PM - 11:00 PM EST; Week One Tuesday: 7:00 PM - 11:00 PM EST
    ```

    ## SUMMARY
    A short one to three sentence summary of the original player message. Refer to the player (LFG) or the group (LFM) in the third person... i.e. "This player is looking for a group of committed raiders" or "This group is looking for a skilled shield healer". You don't need to include much details about the scheduling since you have taken care of that in the 'SCHEDULE' field.

    ## TAGS
    An comma delimited list of tags denoting the intent or purpose of the post. Most players will post these tags inside brackets [] (example... [LFM][MC][Savage][7.0+]). You should parse those out of the brackets and convert them to an array. Additionally if you can infer any other tags from the message itself such as that the player wishes to participate in a week one clear [w1] then add that as well. Please don't make any tags up however, only use terms from the above dictionary for tags. When creating tags always use the term's abbrievation (provided in parathesis) when one is provided (example...HC not Hardcore). Don't include anything pertaining to jobs or roles as we'll cover that in another field.

    ### EXAMPLES

    #### EXAMPLE 1
    **INPUT**
    ```
    [LFM][HC][Savage]
    ```

    **OUTPUT**
    ```
    TAGS:
    LFM,HC,Savage
    ```

    ## JOBS
    An comma delimited list of jobs. If the player message is someone looking for group (LFG) then this should be a list of jobs that they stated they can are capable of performing. Otherwise, if the player message is someone looking for members to join their group (LFM) then this should be a list of jobs that they are looking for in their group. A group that is looking for members (LFM) might list off the jobs and roles they currently have, you can ignore these, only list the jobs they still need. You should infer jobs from roles, if the player message says "I'm looking for a physical ranged dps" then you can infer that BRD, MCH, and DNC are all jobs that they are looking for. Only use job abbreviations here, i.e. DRK not Dark Knight.

    ### EXAMPLES

    #### EXAMPLE 1
    **INPUT**
    ```
    I'm a shield healer that also plays WAR.
    ```

    **OUTPUT**
    ```
    JOBS:
    SCH,SGE,WAR
    ```

    ## DISCORD
    An comma delimited list Discord usernames that were provided in the player message. A Discord username has no spaces and should only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, and periods. Strip any other characters out, i.e. some people like to put @ before their username.

    ### EXAMPLES

    #### EXAMPLE 1
    **INPUT**
    ```
    You can reach us on Discord at player.one or player.two
    ```

    ***OUTPUT***
    ```
    DISCORD:
    player.one,player.two
    ```
